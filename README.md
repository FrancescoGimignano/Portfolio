# Francesco Gimignano Portfolio

Hello, stranger! My name is **Francesco Gimignano**, aka Jimi and this is my portfolio 😁

You can check the live result here 👉🏼 [https://francescogimignano.github.io/portfolio/](https://francescogimignano.github.io/portfolio/)

## 🤔 About the project

This portfolio is made using pure HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. No frameworks are involved 🙅🏼‍♂️

The idea is to  briefly showcase my work and personal experience, in a way that
is appealing to the 21st century (since, you know, PDFs are boring 😪)

But, if you **_really_** need a PDF copy of my CV, you can get it by clicking [right here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dll2aEc7FSmz8LFQYWE8T2pXzzcYqExz/view?usp=sharing).
