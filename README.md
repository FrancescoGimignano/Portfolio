# Francesco Gimignano Portfolio

Hello, stranger! My name is **Francesco Gimignano**, aka Jimi and this is my portfolio 😁

You can check the live result here 👉🏼 [https://jimiit92.github.io/portfolio/](https://jimiit92.github.io/portfolio/)

## 🤔 About the project

This portfolio is made using pure HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. No frameworks are involved 🙅🏼‍♂️

The idea is to  briefly showcase my work and personal experience, in a way that
is appealing to the 21st century (since, you know, PDFs are boring 😪)

But, if you **_really_** need a PDF copy of my CV, you can get it by clicking [right here](#).

## 💻 Why hosting on GitHub?

I choose to host this project on GitHub not only because it's free (although is a valid point 😅) but mostly because I like open source development and I host most of my projects here. 

Also, since I'm showcasing the recent ones in the portfolio as well, I thought it was a good choice to keep everything consistent and host the protfolio here as well.

## 🙏🏼 Credits
